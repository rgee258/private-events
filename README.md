# Eventlike

This is the repo for Eventlike, a private event tracking project that imitates the basic functionality of Eventbrite.

Users can create and attend events, and these events are tracked using Eventlike.

This project is created as part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course. In particular, this project demonstrates
learning associations in Rails, and is built using them.
